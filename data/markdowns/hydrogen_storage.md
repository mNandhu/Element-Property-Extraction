High entropy alloys, Hydrogen storage materials, Composition–properties correlations, Statistical analysis

High entropy alloys (HEAs) formed by multi-principal elements show promising hydrogen storage performance. However, many aspects of their behaviours remain poorly understood. Properties of the HEAs are related to their chemical composition and the nature of their constituent elements, including electronegativity, atomic radii, and valence electron concentration (VEC). Unfortunately, many of the related studies do not adopt unambiguous meaning of these fundamental properties, consequently causing uncertainties. The present review quoting 177 reference publications, aims at clarification of these features by performing systematic analysis of the available experimental data for the multi-component hydrogen storage alloys crystallizing as BCC solid solutions and Laves phase intermetallics. The correlations between the hydrogen sorption performance and the composition-related features including atomic size mismatch, VEC and, most importantly, mixing entropy and enthalpy, have been analysed. We show that VEC plays the most significant role in tuning the hydrogen storage performance of the HEAs. At the same time, no clear correlations of the hydrogen sorption capacity or the enthalpy of hydride formation with other key properties of the HEAs were observed. The correlations were however established when simultaneously accounting the effects of several HEA properties on their hydrogen sorption performance. Based on our observations, we conclude that hydrogen storage performance of the medium- and high-entropy alloys is rather similar, and thus hydride-forming HEAs might be considered as a group of conventional hydrogen storage alloys rather than their separate class.

# 1.   Introduction

Multi-principal element alloys containing five or more individual metals in close to equal atomic fractions have a high mixing entropy and form a new class of metallic materials discovered in early 2000s by Yeh et al. [1] and Cantor et al. [2] and called high entropy alloys (HEAs). Through the following two decades HEAs became a new interdisciplinary field of chemistry, materials science, metallurgy and engineering. The R&D activities in this new field witnessed an explosive development: by the end of February 2023, these first publications [1,2] were cited >7000 and 4000 times, respectively. The number of Scopus-indexed review articles which considered various aspects of properties and applications of HEAs and published since 2010 approaches 500.

High entropy of mixing, which is characteristic for the HEAs, causes the formation of disordered solid solutions. These, however, can undergo phase transitions related to the ordering of the metallic matrix which are accompanied by various interesting phenomena. As a result, HEAs exhibit several unique structural-morphological, thermodynamic and electronic structure features which, in turn, result in sometimes unexpected attractive application-related properties including high strength and increased wear resistance combined with a high-temperature stability. Furthermore, advanced properties of HEAs include their good castability, macroscopic homogeneity and high corrosion resistance.

HEAs, or more generally, high-entropy materials (HEMs), which also include high-entropy oxides (HEOs), nitrides (HENs), carbides (HECs), are very promising for the use in various applications [3–6]. Along with the developments of the advanced ceramics [5], structural [7,8] and refractory [9] materials, biomaterials [10], catalysts [11–13], HEMs significantly contribute to the applications as energy storage and conversion materials – as electrocatalysts for batteries and fuel cells, as water splitting catalysts, and as hydrogen storage materials [6,14,15].

Since their emergence, several synthetic routes have been applied to prepare HEAs. These routes include Laser Engineered Net Shaping.

(LENS) technology [16], inductively coupled thermal plasma treatment [17], vacuum arc melting followed by the suction casting [18], as well as magnetron sputtering, and laser cladding used for the manufacturing of the HEA surface coatings [19]. A review of the use of additive manufacturing technologies for the preparation of HEAs has been published by Torralba et al. [7].

Recent advances in the fundamental understanding of HEAs and HEOs include studies of four basic features contributing to the establishment of the unique properties of HEA, including the effects of configurational entropy, lattice distortion, cocktail mixing and sluggish diffusion. These features have been discussed in detail in a comprehensive review by Miracle and Senkov in 2017 [9] and later by Chen et al. [20] with a special attention paid to the high-temperature performance of the HEAs. The essence of contributions from these four core effects to their behaviours is presented by Fig. 1. In short, high entropy of mixing is associated with the formation of the single-phase alloys where it increases with the growing number of the constituting elements and is the highest for the equal content of each individual constituent.

Cocktail effect is associated with combined contribution of various constituents which when mixed together can affect the chemistry of the interaction with hydrogen in a favourable for the hydride formation way. Sluggish diffusion rate of atoms related to the variation of lattice potential energy, causes an increase in the recrystallization temperature while reducing the particles coarsening rate, thus leading to a nano-crystalline structure. On the other hand, lattice distortion resulting from the mixing of the elements with different atomic sizes, bond energies and crystal structures impede dislocation movement and leads to the solution strengthening.

One of the specific characteristic features of the HEA is a high lattice strain [20] which is favourable for the hydride formation, particularly for the body-centred cubic (BCC) vanadium alloys [24]. Studies of HEAs revealed that the formation of the distorted lattice occurs due to the variety of the values of the atomic radii of the mixed constituent atoms of different types [25].

creates a variety of sizes of the interstitial sites and their distributions that may form extra interstitial sites suitable for the accommodation of hydrogen atoms while satisfying Switendick/Westlake criterium [26,27].

Studies of the hydrogen storage properties of the HEA were first reported in 2010 by Kao et al. [28]. For the TiVZrNbHf alloy, Sahlberg et al. [25] reported a maximum storage capacity of 2.5 at. H/M reached at hydrogen pressure of 53 bar, which is equivalent to 2.7 wt% H. As each of the components of this HEA forms the hydrides with a maximum H content corresponding to the formation of a dihydride MH2, a higher, >2 at. H/M, hydrogen storage capacity of the HEA is unusual. Such a high H storage capacity was attributed to a large difference in the atomic radii between the constituting elements (Ti, V, Zr, Nb and Hf), causing a significant lattice distortion that could favour a more efficient hydrogen uptake. Hydrogenation of another HEA, TiZrNbHfTa, has been explored by Zlotea et al. [29] and H storage capacity of 2.5 H/M exceeding a stoichiometry of the dihydride MH2, has been observed. Further reference studies describing the properties of the hydrogen storage materials based on HEA include [30–35] and will be considered in the present review.

The vast majority of the studied to date hydrogen storage HEAs belong to the solid solution type alloys containing the components with a high affinity to hydrogen (Ti, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, V). These alloys form very stable hydrides and require inconveniently high temperatures, above 400°C, to release the absorbed H2 thus limiting application potential of their hydrides.

Hydrogen storage HEAs also include totally different materials, namely AB5- [31] and AB2-type [28,34] intermetallics characterized by easily achievable and convenient operational P-T conditions allowing to reach a reversibility of the hydride formation and decomposition. In some specific cases hydrogen absorption, even being limited in the H storage capacity, proceeds also for the alloys which do not contain hydride-forming components [36]. In general, the reaction mechanism during the hydride formation by HEAs is not sufficiently well studied yet and needs to be better understood.

Establishing correlations between the hydrogen sorption performances of the variety of HEA and the core parameters affecting the properties of the HEA, was identified as the main goal of the present study, aimed at deepening fundamental understanding of the hydrogen interactions with this class of the hydride-forming materials. A particular focus of this study is on the hydrides of the HEA crystallizing with AB2 Laves type structures. The reason for that is a high abundancy of the Laves type intermetallics forming around 1000 representatives thus creating a vast playground in a variation of their behaviours. The hydrogenation properties of the Laves type alloys were recently reviewed by the authors of this paper [37]. This work showed that Laves type hydrides have equilibrium pressures of hydrogen desorption varying in 10 orders of magnitude and thus being suitable for various applications, as hydrogen storage materials, materials for the thermally managed compression of hydrogen gas, as metal hydride anodes and as hydrogen getters [37].

# 2. General features characterizing the high entropy alloys

Multicomponent alloy formation rule [38] states that the most significant factors which show an important influence on the design of the phase composition of the HEAs include first of all the thermodynamic properties of an alloy defined by the entropy and enthalpy of mixing of the components (ΔSmix and ΔHmix). These properties will be considered in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 below.

# 2.1. Mixing entropy

The entropy of mixing is mainly defined by a configurational term which is calculated as [15,38]:

ΔSmix = R∑(ClnC),N

# 2.2. Mixing enthalpy

The mixing enthalpy in an N-component system can be calculated# T.R. Somo et al.

# Journal of Energy Storage 73 (2023) 108969

using the regular melt model starting from the concentrations (C) taken in atomic fractions and enthalpies of mixing of the i-th and j-th alloy components when in the liquid state (ΔHijmix):

N(N - 1)

ΔHmix = ∑i=1;i≠j ΩijCiCj,

where Ωij = 4 ΔHijmix

8–38 % and 10–25 % for the solid solutions and intermetallic compounds, respectively.

On the other hand, Pauling electronegativity is the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons when it forms bonds with another atom [45]. The variations of Pauling electronegativity difference for HEAs are 2–30 % and 3–20 % for the solid solutions and intermetallic compounds, respectively [46].

# 2.5. Atomic size mismatch

A negative formation enthalpy largely favours homogeneous intermixing in a dissolved pool and causes a fast solidification kinetics. Conversely, a positive formation enthalpy results in a poor intermixing and a formation of inhomogeneous material, with a poor solidification kinetics. Hence, the formation enthalpy can be utilized as a useful controlling parameter when designing the alloy's composition prior to its synthesis [32].

The atomic size mismatch is related to the differences between the atomic radii of the alloy components [38]:

δ = √∑i=1NCi(1 - √(ri/r))2 × 100%

where ri is atomic radius of the i-th component and r = ∑i=1NCiri is the average atomic radius. XRD studies, neutron total scattering measurements coupled with Reverse Monte Carlo structure modelling proved that the lattice distortion is proportional to δ [47].

# 2.6. Key properties which determine formation of thermodynamically stable HEAs

Stability of the constituent phases in the HEAs is a key factor considered in the reference publications. It was shown [15] that the single phase HEAs are formed at certain combinations of their mixing enthalpies (ΔHmix), atomic sizes (δ) and electronegativities (Δχ) mismatches, as well as valence electron concentrations (VEC). The intervals covered by these parameters vary for the solid solution alloys and intermetallic compounds (see Table 1). The multicomponent alloys having these criteria departing from the intervals listed in Table 1, are frequently multiphase or amorphous instead of being single-phase crystalline materials.

The effects of VEC and δ, along with the ratio of atomic radii of A- and B-components on the formation of the intermetallics with Laves phase type structures, as related to rA/rB, have been recently studied by Ponsoni et al. [48] who using CALPHAD method determined the phase stability of the AB2-type alloys (A = Zi, Zr, Nb; B=V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) in connection with their applications as hydrogen storage materials.

However, an interrelation between the hydrogenation behaviours and thermodynamic stability of the HEAs is a complicated and multifaceted topic due to unconventional thermodynamic behaviours of these alloys [49]. Furthermore, for the multicomponent alloys, the phase separation and atomic ordering are two important additional features. This is because HEAs can undergo phase transformations, resulting in the formation of distinct phases with varying compositions [50]. In fact, according to Wang et al. [51], at low temperatures all “normal” HEAs should undergo phase ordering/phase separations, as a contribution from the configurational entropy vanishes when the temperature approaches 0 K. These mentioned phenomena can affect the overall thermodynamic stability and mechanical properties of the HEA. Lastly and most importantly, various HEA phases are metastable or show a limited thermodynamic stability due to their complex chemistry and unconventional compositions [52,53].

# 2.7. Comments on some key properties of the HEAs

Most of the key properties of HEAs can be derived from their composition, accounted in combination with the properties of the constituent elements, including electronegativities, atomic radii and valence electron concentrations. The reference data for the constituent elements of the HEAs, r, χ and VEC, are reported in the review [9]. However, it should be kept in the mind that the meanings of the elemental properties may be ambiguous. As an example, the atomic radius of the element in an alloy (ri in Eq. (9)) should be derived from the interatomic distances between the atoms in the individual solid metal thus depending on the coordination number, modification, and valence [61], with Pearson radii being the most reliable ones. The electronegativities (χ) can be presented in different scales, e.g., Pauling or Allen ones (see Section 2.4). Finally, the valence electron concentrations (VEC) frequently counted as a total number of the electrons in the outer shell of the element [9] actually, should account only electrons participating in the metallic bonding [61,62].

Table S1 of the Supplementary information file presents the basic properties of the elements while accounting the above-mentioned features. Even though electronegativities and atomic radii derived by different methods show certain correlations, sometimes they exhibit noticeable differences exceeding 20 %. At the same time, the differences in the VEC for the d-elements of Groups 7–12 become dramatic, particularly when considering the values presented by Mizutani and Sato [62], which took into account crystal and electronic structures of 54 elementary metals.

The values of δ, Δχ and VEC presented below correspond to the data from the original publications. At the same time, when comparing the data on hydrogen storage properties of the different HEAs, we refer to the specific meanings of the elemental properties taken for the calculation of these parameters to make their correct comparison.

# 3. Hydrogen storage properties of HEAs

Hydrogen storage characteristics of metallic hydrides are determined by several factors related to the composition of the alloys, crystal and electronic structures, morphology aspects and other intrinsic properties of the parent and hydrogenated materials [63,64]. The most important applied characteristics of the hydrides are the reversible hydrogen storage capacity and the electrochemical discharge capacity of the alloys when interacting with hydrogen gas [65] or used as the metal hydride anodes [66]. These characteristics are strongly dependent on the operating conditions (temperature, hydrogen pressure, electrode potential) and are defined by the thermodynamics of hydrogen interaction with the parent materials.

Any chemical process is thermodynamically favourable if it is accompanied by a decrease of the Gibbs free energy (ΔG < 0). In turn, ΔG depends on the process enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS) and temperature (T) as follows:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. (10)

Accordingly, direction of the reversible process of hydride formation/decomposition is determined by the sign of ΔG. When ΔG < 0, the hydride formation takes place, while ΔG > 0 corresponds to a reverse reaction of hydrogen release/hydride decomposition. Keeping in mind that the value of ΔG is a sum of the reaction enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy-based (TΔS) terms (see Eq. (10)), the temperature, T0, at which ΔG = 0 equals to

T0 = ΔH / ΔS (11)

In other words, the hydride is formed at T < T0 and decomposes at T > T0, and its thermal stability (T0) depends on both ΔH and ΔS. ΔH depends on the energy of H–M and M–M interactions. For the hydrogenation of the intermetallic alloy, it can be estimated from the values of the formation enthalpies of binary hydrides of the alloy constituents and formation enthalpy of the intermetallic compound obtained by using Miedema's rule of reversed stability [67–70]. Miedema's rule uses a semi-empirical approach to estimate the formation enthalpy of the metal alloys and compounds based on the approaches applied for the thermodynamic calculations of the metals [44]. The same approach can be used for the estimation of the enthalpy of hydrogenation of solid solution alloys since Miedema's model considers hydride of intermetallic compound as a mixture of imaginary binary hydrides of its components [69], and the formation enthalpy of the intermetallic compound can be replaced by the mixing enthalpy of the solid solution.

The main contributor to the entropy of the hydride formation is the standard entropy of molecular hydrogen (130.52 J/(mol H2 K)). However, formation entropies experimentally observed for many intermetallic hydrides [71] are significantly lower in their absolute values (e.g., below 120 J/(mol H2 K) for the AB2±x Laves phase hydrides). Such differences are higher for the multicomponent and non-stoichiometric intermetallics. The less negative values of the hydride formation entropies can be explained by the increased entropy of the hydride as related to its metallic matrix. Even for the same arrangement of the metallic atoms in the parent and hydrogenated alloy, thus equally contributing to their absolute entropies, an additional increase in the absolute entropy value of the hydride can appear due to a more significant variation of the “faceting” (coordination polyhedra) for the interstitial sites which formally belong to the same type and can be occupied by H atoms. This happens when the number of the components of the metallic alloy increases or the stoichiometric ratio between the components A and B of the intermetallic compound is modified. An example is A2B2 tetrahedral interstitial sites in the AB2-type Laves phase structures. For the binary intermetallics there exists only several of its types: one (96g) for the C15 MgCu2 Laves type structure and four (6h1, 6h2, 12k1, 24l) for the C14 MgZn2 Laves type structure [72–74]. However, an introduction of a substituting component (e.g., A′) results in the appearance of (A1–xA′)2B2 interstitials with variable fractions of A′ (x) in the A-sites. As a result, the number of microstates for an interstitial site which can be occupied with H atom may significantly increase thus contributing to the increase of the metallic matrix-dependent term of the.# T.R.

# Fig. 2. Schematic representation of the pressure-composition isotherms in the metal–hydrogen systems.

1 – ideal flat plateau isotherm; 2 – effect of stress; 3 – effect of compositional inhomogeneities. Adopted from [77].

It should be noted that for an “ideal” hydrogen storage material a phase transformation between the saturated α-solid solution of hydrogen in the metal matrix and β-hydride corresponds to an unambiguous (i.e., only temperature dependent according to Eq. (10)) change of the Gibbs free energy (ΔGα→β), so the hydride formation takes place at a constant pressure on the pressure–composition isotherm (“plateau” in curve 1, see Fig. 2). Then, ΔGα→β and the plateau pressure (P) are related as [75]:

ΔGα→β = RT ln(P0/Pp),

where P0 = 1 atm is the standard/reference pressure. Combining Eqs. (10), (12) yields a well-known van't Hoff equation:

ln(P0/Pp) = ΔGα→β = (ΔSα→β + ΔHα→β) / (RT)

At the same time, pressure–composition isotherms in the real systems of H2 gas with hydride-forming metals and alloys exhibit a deviation from the ideal behaviour, which is manifested by the appearance of the extended areas of α- and β-solid solutions with continuously changing H-content dependent thermodynamics of the α- and β-phases and sloping plateaux due to the effect of stresses (curve 2 in Fig. 2) and compositional inhomogeneities (curve 3 in Fig. 2) which cause changes of the ΔGα→β when hydrogen concentration in the material varies. The stress effects during α↔β transformations also cause hysteresis so the plateau pressure of H2 absorption is higher than the one for H2 desorption. Further details related to the non-ideal shape of the pressure–composition isotherms in the hydrogen–metal systems can be found in [76–78] and references therein.

Due to a large number of constituent elements and a broad variation of the values of their atomic radii, the appearance of both compositional inhomogeneities and stresses in HEA is likely, and thus the hydride-forming HEA show incline plateaux in their pressure–composition isotherms. Consequently, their reversible hydrogen storage capacity becomes highly sensitive to the selection of the operating temperatures and hydrogen pressures.

Recently, Zepon et al. [79] proposed a thermodynamic model of pressure–composition–temperature (PCT) diagrams for the systems of H2 gas with multicomponent alloys including HEAs. The main feature of the proposed model is in a consideration of configurational entropy terms for both the starting alloy and the hydride when taking into account the site blocking effects [80]. The model has a prediction capacity for H concentration limits of the two-phase regions on the pressure–composition isotherms and the corresponding plateau pressures. The model was used for the screening of the Laves phase HEAs for hydrogen storage applications and verified by experimental data measured on the C14 Laves phase HEAs [48].

Another important feature that is unique for the HEAs is in the formation of the interface dislocations during the crystallization process, causing therefore a severe lattice distortion [62,81]. Dislocations can increase the activity of the surface to hydrogen absorption. As an example, the presence of grain boundaries and defects appearing during the application of the high-pressure torsion technique processing of a series of TiV alloys created efficient pathways for hydrogen penetration as reported in [82]. The activated TiV alloy absorbed ~4 wt% H already at ambient conditions without a need of its heating to reach the hydrogenation.

Conversely, the presence of dislocations and lattice defects may degrade the absorption/desorption reversibility since it causes hydrogen trapping which is frequently observed for the conventional (low- and medium-entropy) alloys and intermetallic compounds. One example is hydrogen absorption by a TiCr1.8 alloy where the amount of the trapped hydrogen exceeds 20 % of the total hydrogen storage capacity of the intermetallic compound [83]. In [84] it was reported that hydrogen concentration in bulk Pd was negligible as compared to the content of hydrogen trapped by the dislocations with about 30 % of the total amount of absorbed hydrogen being trapped at dislocations at room temperature. The trapping appears to be irreversible resulting in a decrease of the reversible hydrogen storage capacity of the material at the applied experimental pressure–temperature conditions. Since the concentration of the defects in HEA is higher than in the conventional alloys, the associated H trapping effect may result in a lower reversible hydrogen sorption capacity thus limiting application potential of this type of hydrogen storage materials. At the same time, the presence of trapping sites is very important in some special cases including tritium handling for nuclear applications where HEAs provide an ability to accommodate helium gas formed during the β-decay of tritium [85].

Above all, the nature of the compositional constituents and the level of their affinity to hydrogen have a primary importance when determining the hydrogenation performance of the HEAs. Furthermore, Keith et al. [86] noticed that interstitial hydrides of the HEAs with a random atomic distribution of metal elements hold a key advantage in applicability of these materials, particularly for the single-phase hydrides.

# 4. Correlations between the key properties of the HEAs and their hydrogen sorption performance

To further elucidate the hydrogenation ability of the HEAs, we have established a database containing the data for the equimolar and close-to-equimolar single phase HEAs. Near-equimolar HEAs contain multiple principal elements with atomic content ranging between 5 and 35 %. For comparison, we also included in the database some entries related to the low-entropy (LEA) and medium-entropy (MEA) alloys. The selection criteria to prepare the database accounted the following points:

1. The considered alloys were limited to two groups of hydrogen storage materials (BCC-type solid solutions and Laves phase type intermetallics) for which experimental data on the hydrogen storage behaviours were reported.# T.R. Somo et al.

# Journal of Energy Storage 73 (2023) 108969

Types of intermetallic structures or solid solutions were not accounted due to a very limited systematic reference data available in the literature.

(2) To perform unbiased evaluations, the statistical analysis has been focused on the hydrogen storage performances of the single phase HEAs and was performed separately for the BCC and AB2 alloys.

Electron concentrations for the BCC alloys (Fig. 3(d)). When considering this data, we observe that the differences between the hydride-forming medium- and high-entropy alloys are rather diffuse, and thus, as it was noted earlier, HEAs should be considered as a group belonging to the conventional hydrogen storage alloys rather than a separate class of the metal hydrides.

# 4.2. Elemental constituents of the HEAs

The collected reference data are summarised in Appendix A, Tables A.1 and A.2 (sorted in order of ascending entropy of mixing), and include:

- Alloy Composition.
- Preparation route – arc melting (AM), melt spinning (MS), ball milling in the inert gas (BM) or in hydrogen (HRBM), direct laser metal deposition (DLMD), laser engineered net shaping (LENS).
- Alloy type – low-entropy (LEA), medium-entropy (MEA), high-entropy (HEA).
- Unit cell volume per one averaged metal atom, VM [Å3].
- Enthalpy (ΔHform [kJ/mol]) and entropy (ΔSform [J/mol K]) of hydrogenation.
- Electronegativity mismatch, Δχ [%] calculated using Pauling electronegativities of the alloy components.
- Atomic size mismatch, δ [%], which is calculated using Pearson atomic radii of the components.
- Valence electron concentration, VEC, calculated as a weighted average of the VECs for the alloy components separately taken as a total number of the electrons in the outer shell of the element.
- Entropy of mixing, ΔSmix [J/mol K].
- Enthalpy of mixing, ΔHmix [kJ/mol].
- Hydrogen pressure applied for the hydrogenation, P [bar].
- Hydrogenation temperature, T [°C].
- Maximum hydrogen-to-metal atomic ratio, H/M, achieved at the applied pressure-temperature conditions.

As it follows from Fig. 4, both BCC (A) and Laves phase (B) hydride-forming alloys predominantly contain the elements with a high affinity to hydrogen (coloured boxes). The frequency of the appearance of the active hydride forming elements in the BCC alloys (73.2 %; mostly, Ti, V, Nb and Zr), is higher than that for the AB2-type Laves phases (57.6%; mostly, Zr, Ti and V) confirming a general observation that BCC HEAs usually form more stable hydrides than the Laves phases-based hydrides.

Of the elements which do not form stable hydrides, Cr and Fe appear in the compositions of both BCC and Laves phase HEAs most frequently. Specific properties are sensitive to the elemental composition. As an example, in [90] it was found that the BCC/B2 coherent morphology is closely related to the lattice misfit, ε, between these two phases which is a very sensitive feature and can be varied by changing the content of Al as described by the following equation:

ε = 2*(aB2 aBCC)/(aB2 + aBCC)

# 4.1. General statistical trends

Table 2 summarises the data describing the mixing entropies for the alloys analysed in this review (Tables A.1 and A.2). Almost half (49.4 %) of the alloys satisfy the entropy-based definition of high-entropy alloys, ΔSmix ≥ 1.5R = 12.47 J mol-1 K-1.

The corresponding enthalpies of mixing for the hydrogen storage alloys vary in broad range covering an interval between -26.8 and +12.6 kJ/mol. There is a slight trend of a decrease of the mixing enthalpies when the mixing entropies increase, even though the correlation between these two parameters is rather weak.

At the same time, the ranges of the variation of the main alloy parameters which are required to form the corresponding single-phase HEAs and the reference data exhibit a reasonable agreement (see Fig. 3), particularly, when considering the mixing enthalpies (Fig. 3(a)). The agreement becomes less satisfactory when considering the electronegativity mismatch for the AB2 and BCC alloys (Fig. 3(c)) and valence.

# 4.3. Preparation methods

Different preparation methods can significantly influence the hydrogen storage behaviour of the alloys. The synthetic routes are very important for the alloys forming polymorphic modifications. Each individual applied method affects the homogeneity of the material, its microstructure, crystal structure, formation of defects, which in turn has a direct impact on its hydrogen storage behaviours. We will present the frequency of use of different preparation methods utilized to synthesize the alloy materials considered in this study (Tables A.1 and A.2). As is clear from Fig. 5 below, arc melting (AM) is the most commonly used method for all types of the alloys.

Arc melting is the most convenient preparation technique. During the arc melting, a rapid melting, mixing of the constituents and crystallization of the final products are achieved in a short period of time. Consequently, arc melted products form the structures with less defects, simplifying characterization of these materials. Because of the efficiency of arc melting, it is preferred for the preparation of the alloys.

For the hydrogen storage materials special attention should be given to the control over the cooling rate after the melting, as slow cooling results in larger grains, potentially reducing the rates of hydrogen diffusion in the bulk material. In contrast, rapid solidification normally leads to finer microstructures causing enhanced kinetics of hydrogen exchange during the formation-decomposition of the hydrides.

The second most preferred preparation method is ball milling (BM), during which the prepared material undergoes repeated cold welding, fracturing, and rewelding.# T.R. Somo et al.

The melting process, is preferred when synthesizing the alloys containing light elements. It allows expanding the solid solubility ranges in the studied systems, favouring the formation of extended solid solutions. The refined microstructures obtained via the ball milling show advanced hydrogen sorption performance, particularly, the ones based on the system Mg/MgH2 [96].

The other well-known but less frequently used methods are melt spinning (MS) and Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS). Melt spinning involves rapid quenching of a molten alloy on a spinning wheel, producing a ribbon-like structure. This results in the refinement of the grain sizes and formation of the metastable phases. The latter are known to contain extra active sites enabling efficient hydrogen sorption, which causes improved hydrogenation kinetics and results in achieving higher hydrogen uptake. Zhang et al. [97] demonstrated that an increase of the wheel spinning rate reduces the activation energy of hydrogen absorption-desorption resulting in increased rates of hydrogen desorption from the Mg25 xYxNi9Cu (x = 0, 1, 3, 5, 7) alloys based hydrides.

Palade et al. [98] compared hydrogen storage properties of the mixtures of MgH2 with Ni and Fe powders, where one mixture was prepared by a combination of ball milling and melt spinning while the other one was prepared by ball milling only. M¨ossbauer spectroscopy revealed that in the samples prepared by combining the two mentioned methods iron is mainly present in a disordered structure in a solid solution and segregates after the hydrogenation, while it remains mostly unalloyed in the ball milled powders. After the multiple hydrogen absorption/desorption cycles the main part of iron appears to be in the metallic state in the samples of both types, while the materials prepared using melt spinning showed a better hydrogen desorption kinetics.

Another important preparation method is LENS, which uses a high-energy laser beam to melt and fuse together metal powders, preparing.# T.R. Somo et al.

# 4.4. A correlation between the mixing entropy and hydrogen sorption properties

The correlations between the hydrogen sorption performance and key properties of HEAs are considered below and are described in detail in a Supplementary information file (Section 2; Figs. S1–S4).

Entropy of mixing is very important in defining numerous physico-chemical phenomena, not least for the reactions taking place at the surfaces and for the catalytic processes taking place in the confined systems. Thus, an understanding of the role of ΔSmix in defining the hydrogen storage of the HEAs has proven to be challenging from both experimental and theoretical perspectives.

Calculations of the mixing entropies according to Eqs. (1), (2) for the typical Ti–Zr–Cr–Fe–Mn–V HEAs with Laves type phase structures show that they vary in the ranges ΔSmix = 14.7–14.9 J mol-1 K-1 and ΔS'mix = 17.1–17.3 J mol-1 K-1. At the same time, the corresponding values calculated for the multi-component AB2±x Laves phases with the same constituents taken in various proportions, which were studied by the authors during the hydrogen gas-alloy interactions and electrochemically, when used as electrodes of the metal hydride batteries, are very close in their values, being just marginally (~20%) lower.

However, hydrogen sorption properties of these materials exhibiting well pronounced plateaux on the pressure-composition isotherms significantly differ from the ones for the Laves-phase HEAs which show absence of plateaux in their pressure-composition isotherms. The reasons for such a pronounced difference remain unclear but such a behaviour may be related to a preferential distribution of the metallic atoms around particular interstitial sites causing variations of the probabilities of their occupancy by the H-atoms. That's why, further in-depth experimental studies for the determination of the distribution of the components over the specific positions in the structures of the intermetallic HEAs and H/D site occupancies in their hydrides/deuterides (synchrotron X-ray and powder neutron diffraction) are very important to deepen the knowledge concerning their hydrogenation mechanism and to guide the selection of the multi-component intermetallic alloys for various applications.

The plots demonstrating correlations between ΔSmix, H/M and enthalpy of hydride formation are depicted in Figs. S1(a) to S4(a). These plots spread over a broad range of the values and are highly non-linear. Therefore, the mixing entropy of HEAs does not show a direct influence on the hydrogen storage behaviours as far as hydrogen content H/M and hydride formation enthalpy are concerned.

# 4.5. A correlation between the mixing enthalpy and hydrogen absorption behaviours

Earlier the focus of the research efforts was on the studies of the influence of ΔHmix on the structure of HEAs while less attention has been paid to its influence on the hydrogen storage performance. Thus, it is important to elucidate a possible relationship between these two.

Figs. S1(b) and S2(b) reveal an absence of a correlation between ΔHmix and hydrogen storage capacity H/M for both BCC alloys and Laves phases. At the same time, Figs. S3(b) and S4(b) show a clear correlation between ΔHmix and the enthalpy of hydride formation (ΔHform). The distribution predominantly follows a unified pattern, indicating a reliable relationship between these two variables.

For the BCC alloys (Fig. S3(b)) an apparent decrease of ΔHform with the increase of ΔHmix was observed, while for the AB2-type intermetallics (Fig. S4(b)) ΔHform increases when ΔHmix increases above.

# 4.6. Correlation of VEC with hydrogen sorption properties

Further to its influence on the phase stabilities of the alloys, VEC is also related to the hydrogen sorption performances of the HEAs. As an example, the dehydrogenation onset temperature (Tonset) is inversely proportional to the VEC for a series of the Ti0.30V0.25Zr0.10Nb0.25M0.10 HEAs with M = Mg, Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo and Ta [109]. This implies that increasing VEC decreases Tonset, causing the lowering of the thermal stability of the hydride phase. Reverse Monte Carlo calculations of the local structure of TiVNbD5.7 showed that the local metal-hydrogen interactions in the tetrahedral interstices are not affected by the size of these sites. Therefore, it can be suggested that hydrogen desorption characteristics are defined by the chemical surrounding and thus it starts from the interstitial sites surrounded by the atoms with a larger VEC. To elucidate this relationship, the VEC values for the different HEAs taken from the reference data are plotted in a scatter plot against their corresponding H/M and enthalpies of hydride formation values ΔHform (Figs. S1(e) to S4(e)). No clear correlation was observed between the VEC and H/M for both sets of the data. Interestingly, it appears that there exists an optimal range of VEC, ~5.2 to 5.7, which favours reaching the maximum values of the hydrogen storage capacities H/M. Thus, this range of VEC is preferable when high entropy alloys are considered as materials for the efficient hydrogen storage. However, reaching a reversibility of hydrogen storage could be a challenging issue. Indeed, while it was shown experimentally [33] that when VEC > 6.4 hydrogen desorption may occur at temperatures as low as 25°C, however, efficient hydrogen desorption becomes a problem when VEC < 6.4 [33]. The latter is further substantiated in [109] in which it was observed that the onset temperature of desorption increases almost linearly with VEC for a BCC type HEAs series (Ti0.30V0.25Zr0.10Nb0.25M0.10 with M = Mg, Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, Ta). Furthermore, it has been suggested that increasing the VEC by alloying with late 3d transition metals because of the filling of the unoccupied valence states will not allow to accommodate extra electrons from the interstitial hydrogen atoms, which is obviously unfavourable for the efficient hydrogen storage performance. Experimental studies indicate that steric effects do not influence this trend and thus electronic structure studies become very important [109]. Furthermore, Figs. S3(e) and S4(e) show a good correlation between the VEC and ΔHform. For the BCC alloys, ΔHform generally becomes less negative changing from 75 up to 35 kJ/mol with VEC increasing from 4.2 to 5.5, suggesting that increasing VEC to 5.5 results in a destabilisation of the hydrides. AB2 alloys have larger VEC values, ranging from 5.5 to 7.2 while ΔHform decreases with increasing VEC within this range.

# 4.7. Correlation of electronegativity difference and hydrogen storage properties

Electronegativity difference together with atomic size mismatch and VEC form three parameters having the strongest impact on the storage performance of the hydride-forming alloys. As an example, Wu et al. [110] showed that doping of elements with high electronegativity reduces dehydrogenation energy by nearly 25 %. Lu et al. [111] recently When mixing the elements with a significant variation of the atomic sizes into one lattice, a residual strain field will be induced because of the size mismatch (δ) and the elastic modulus variations between the metals. Significant differences between the constituents of the HEA causing high values of δ may create severe lattice distortions which induce high strength and hardness of HEAs by restricting dislocation movement. Severe lattice distortion causes the formation of interface dislocations [62,81]. Dislocations may activate the surface of the hydrogen storage alloy for hydrogen absorption as this often results in the formation of the sites attractive for the accommodation of H atoms [26,27]. One example is Ti–V alloys where the presence of grain boundaries and defects appearing during the high-pressure torsion technique processing created efficient pathways for the penetration of hydrogen atoms into the metal [112]. Nygard et al. [113] evaluated a series of HEAs in order to relate δ with the H/M ratio, and concluded absence of any correlation. Our present study involving a larger group of the materials also shows that a clear relationship between the δ and H/M cannot be established, as it follows from Figs. S1(f) and S2(f). In contrast, we observe a correlation between δ and ΔHform (Fig. S3(f) – BCC and Fig. S4(f) – AB2). Indeed, ΔHform increases when δ increases for the BCC alloys while ΔHform decreases when δ increases for the AB2 alloys. A large δ is known to induce a phase separation in the HEAs. One example of such a behaviour is a phase separation observed in a AlCoCrFeNi HEA, which exhibited a two-phase structure, consisting of a BCC phase and an FCC phase [114]. This was attributed to the atomic size mismatch between the different elements in the alloy. Similarly, microstructure studies of CuCrFeCoNi HEA revealed the appearance of the phase separation in the form of nanoscale coherent precipitates [1]. In both cases, the phase separation was attributed to a high δ. As a result, HEAs with a high δ (>8 % for BCC alloys and >10 % for the Laves phases alloys) absorb small amounts of hydrogen, while elemental segregation and phase separation occur. Furthermore, Zlotea et al. [29] suggested that increased values of δ may facilitate a one-step reaction of an intermetallic alloy with hydrogen (BCC → BCT hydride), while a smaller values of δ would favour a two-steps phase transition (BCC → BCT → FCC). Large δ is associated with a severe lattice distortion, which in most cases causes a slow hydrogen diffusion [115]. As an example, Xie et al. [116] employed DFT studies to investigate the diffusion of hydrogen in the FeCoNiCrMn HEA material. The authors reported that severe lattice distortions appearing in the HEAs lead to a broad range distribution of local hydrogen dissolution energies, while the trapping of hydrogen in the low energy sites increased the diffusion barriers. These diffusion barriers break periodicity and symmetry of hydrogen transfer in the HEAs, leading to a sluggish diffusion of hydrogen while decreasing the content of the stored hydrogen. Another example is described in the work [117] where upon substituting Fe for Mn in a BCC V0.35Ti0.3Cr0.25Mn0.1 HEA, Liu et al. [117] observed that δ increased while the alloy absorbed a much-decreased amount of hydrogen.# 5. Discussion

Early works on the studies of the HEA as hydrogen storage materials reported that the storage capacity of the HEA is unexpectedly high, exceeding the sums of the capacities which can be provided by adding up the values for the individual constituent metals. In the present study we aimed to find out whether the available experimental data for two important groups of the hydride-forming alloys, Laves-type intermetallics and BCC alloys, show any correlation between the hydrogen storage behaviours and their association with any of the groups of the alloys defined by their mixing entropy of the formation, LEA/MEA/HEA.

Such a comparison is performed by plotting the ΔSmix against H/M and enthalpy of formation for the single phase Laves phases and BCC alloys in normalized 3D scatter plots shown in Figs. 6 and 7, with the projections on the plane “ΔSmix–H/M”.

It is evident that the majority of the HEAs crystallizing in the Laves phase structures have higher ΔSmix than the BCC HEAs counterparts. As ΔSmix is dependent on the number of the constituent components, hence a 10-component alloy Ti12Zr21.5V10Cr7.5Mn8.1Fe4CoNi32.2Sn0.3Al0.4 has the largest mixing entropy of 16.2 J/kmol while a 2-component Laves type alloy TiMn2 has the smallest mixing entropy of just 5.29 J/kmol.

When it comes to the hydrogen storage capacities, BCC alloys reach higher H/M values. Indeed, BCC metals and alloys (Ti, V, Ti1 x3, 4.0 wt % H) have a remarkably high theoretical capacity, H/M = 2.0; 150 kgH/m3. However, only half of the hydride capacity accumulated in the HIM.

# 5.1 Multi-factor correlations between the key properties and hydrogen sorption performances of the HEAs

As it can be seen from the data presented in Sections 4.3–4.7 (see also Figs. S1–S4 in the Supplementary information), obvious correlations between the key properties of the single-phase HEAs taken separately and hydrogen sorption capacities of these materials have not been established. The reason for that could be in varying influence of these factors on the hydrogen storage performance when considering a large group of the alloys with different chemistry. Thus, we have considered multi-factor correlations instead of limiting our approach to the effect of a single key property dependences.

Based on the findings above, it is evident that the three categories of alloys, i.e., HEAs, MEAs and LEAs, containing either BCC or Laves phase as a major phase behave similarly in hydrogen storage-related applications. In addition, the three categories are designed by controlling mainly their mixing entropy and other structural parameters, otherwise the preparation is the same. Because there is no distinct difference in preparing these alloys, their hydrogen storage behaviours are similar to other conventional alloys, and HEAs could be considered as a group of conventional hydrogen storage alloys rather than a separate class of the alloys. This is confirmed by the statistical analysis of hydrogen sorption capacities of these alloys (see Fig. S6 in the Supplementary information file) showing that the distribution histograms for LEAs, MEAs and HEAs for BCC and C14-Laves phases exhibit very similar pattern.

The factors affecting the hydrogen storage behaviours of the HEA have been earlier discussed in several publications. In Table 3 we give a summary presenting the approaches used in the reference data to explain the behaviours of the HEA as hydrogen storage materials and compare these approaches with our conclusions, based on the analysis.

As an example of use of the described approach, we illustrate its application for the case of C14-Laves phase intermetallic CoFeMnTiVZr (Table A.2). The following numerical values of the variables were used: X1 = VM = 14.27 Å3/at(M).# T.R. Somo et al.

X2 = ΔHmix(hydride)–ΔHmix(alloy) = 17.05 kJ/at(M + H), X3 = ΔSmix = 14.90 J/(at(M) K), X4 = Δχ (Pauling) = 9.25 %, X5 = ẟ = 11.42 %, and X6 = VEC (Mizutani-Sato) = 1.137. When introducing these values into Eq. (15), along with the fitted during the refinements values of A1…A6, we obtained H/M (calc) = 0.96 which converges with the experimentally determined H/M value for this intermetallic alloy (0.94) showing an excellent correlation and validating the approach.

The values of the coefficients A1…A6 obtained by fitting of the reference data are presented in Table 4, and Table S2. It appears that the most important factor affecting the hydrogen sorption capacity of HEAs is the valence electron concentration (VEC). This is concluded from the highest absolute values of the corresponding regression coefficient (A6) as compared to the other regression coefficients (A1…A5). Thus, we conclude that hydrogen sorption performance of the HEAs is mainly affected by the chemical nature/electronic structure of their components.

The fitting results were found to be very sensitive to the starting data of the VEC calculations. All three ways to account the VEC were considered by us, including: 1) taking into consideration a total number of electrons in the outer shell; 2) based on a Pearson's valence; or 3) accounting the electrons participating in the metallic bonding according to Mizutani-Sato.

The best fitting was achieved when considering the metallic bonding by using the Mizutani-Sato approach. Table 4 presents the fitted coefficients A1–A6.

A similar but slightly less successful fitting was achieved when accounting VEC using approaches 1 (Outer shell) and 2 (Pearson's valence). The fitting results are given in a Supplementary Information (Table S2).

The corresponding plots of the values of H/M calculated using Eq. (15) (Y-axis) versus the reported H/M values (X-axis) when VEC is calculated by accounting the electrons participating in the metallic bonding according to Mizutani-Sato, a total number of electrons in the outer shell and Pearson's valence are shown in Figs. 8 and S5(A), correspondingly. The fitting gives a better fit when applying the Mizutani-Sato method (Fig. 8), even though two other approaches to account the VEC provide only slightly less successful results (Fig. S5(B, C)).

We note that the values of the particular regression coefficients fitted when taking VEC data calculated using different methods exhibit significant differences (see Table S2), which is translated to their different contributions of the corresponding variables/key properties in the changes of the calculated response. That is why, during any modelling of the influence of key properties of HEAs on their hydrogen sorption performance, the method of VEC evaluation (as this property is considered as one on the key factors) should be explicitly specified.

When analysing the fitting results, we observe that some experimental points quite significantly deviate from the trend lines for each of these three considered definitions of the VEC values. Such a behaviour is most likely caused by an application of the variable P–T conditions of.

# 6. Conclusions

In the present work we performed a systematic analysis of the hydrogen storage performance of HEA, as related to the composition-related parameters such as atomic size mismatch, VEC and, most importantly, mixing entropy and enthalpy. We studied the influence of these parameters on the behaviours of the hydride-forming alloys. This was achieved by statistical analysis of the effect of five parameters characterizing the HEAs on the enthalpy of hydride formation and H/M ratio. The following conclusions were reached:

- The mixing entropy of HEAs does not show a direct influence on the hydrogen storage behaviours as far as hydrogen content H/M and hydride formation enthalpy are concerned.
- The best correlations were observed when simultaneously accounting the effects of several HEA properties - 6 in total - on their hydrogen sorption performance.
- VEC plays the most significant role in tuning the hydrogen storage performance of the HEA. VEC and H/M show proportional correlations for both BCC alloys and Laves type intermetallics. The maximum H/M ratios are obtained when VEC/number of electrons in the outer shell appear within the range of 5.2 to 5.7. The Laves phases-based HEAs with ΔHmix of 15 to 5 kJ/mol are the most suitable candidates for the hydrogen storage applications as demonstrating high H/M ratios and favourable for the reversible hydrogenation-dehydrogenation values of ΔHform.
- No clear correlations of H/M or enthalpy of hydride formation and electronegativity mismatch were observed. Furthermore, the values of ΔSmix and those of atomic size mismatch spread over a wide range and show absence of correlation.

Based on these observations, we assume that the criteria distinguishing the performance of the medium- and high-entropy alloys as belonging to the different classes of hydrogen storage materials are quite fuzzy, and HEAs could be considered as a group of conventional hydrogen storage alloys rather than a separate class of the alloys. Still the chemistry of such systems is interesting and, in some cases, unique because of mixing together the elemental components with very variable properties – valence, electronegativity, hydrogenation ability, atomic size, melting temperature, density, etc. For the multicomponent system, the mixing entropy values depend on the number of the components in the system forming solid solutions and gradually grow with an increase in this number. Fundamental understanding of the ordering behaviours in the multicomponent systems becomes increasingly important. To better assess the ordering behaviours in the multicomponent systems, it is necessary to consider various aspects of the metal-hydrogen interactions, including the mechanisms of hydrogen interaction with HEAs, site occupancies by H atoms in the interstitial sites, reversibility of hydrogen storage performance, cycle stability, activation behaviours, as many aspects if the interaction remain unclear. Further experimental and theoretical studies are required, including synchrotron diffraction (to determine the local and long-range ordering of the metal atoms around interstitial sites), neutron diffraction (to directly locate H/D atoms in the crystal structures), accompanied by the total scattering and Reverse Monte Carlo modelling studies. These studies will deepen the fundamental knowledge of the Me-H systems enabling explanation of the performance of HEA as hydrogen storage materials particularly as related to the variety of interstitial sites with different chemical surrounding associated with the types and number of the constituent elements. Further extensive research, particularly involving the theoretical studies, should be prioritised to clarify the operating mechanisms governing the hydrogen storage performance.

# Table A.2

Hydrogen storage properties of multi-component alloys with C14 Laves type phase structures. Alloy type – low-entropy (LEA), medium-entropy (MEA), high-entropy (HEA). ΔSmix [J/mol K] – entropy of mixing. ΔHmix [kJ/mol] – enthalpy of mixing. VM [Å3] – Unit cell volume per one averaged metal atom. ΔHform [kJ/mol] – enthalpy of hydrogenation. ΔSform [J/mol K] –entropy of hydrogenation. Δχ [%] – electronegativity mismatch calculated using Pauling electronegativities of the alloy components [78]. δ [%] – atomic size mismatch calculated using Pearson atomic radii of the components [77]. VEC – valence electron concentration calculated as a weighted average of the VECs for the alloy components separately taken as a total number of the electrons in the outer shell of the element [77]/“Shell”, Pearson's maximum valence [77]/“Pearson”, or accounting only electrons participating in the metallic bonding according to Mizutani and Sato [79]/“MS”. P [bar] – hydrogen pressure applied for the hydrogenation. T [°C] – hydrogenation temperature. H/M – maximum hydrogen-to-metal atomic ratio achieved at the applied pressure - temperature conditions.
